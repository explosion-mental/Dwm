# Dwm
My build of dwm

## Patches
You can see them and 'unpatch' them if you want to.

## DWM.C
There all a lot of comments on functions that I don't use or are useless in some cases. Taake a look before doing anything :)

Made this in case I broke anything. This is my definitive build.
### Mayor improvements:
- xrdb patch finally working with pywal without restarting (Mar 01 2021)
